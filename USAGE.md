# 3SC PHP Task

### How to use my app 

The app I have created has been designed to run on a linux operating system via the command line and it's controlled by following its interactive menu system. 

The app can be built by following the same instructions as in the README.md as well as running the additional unit tests.

> git clone, composer install etc..

To begin, run the following command.

```bash
$ php app/app.php
```

The app is simple and uses the provided interfaces and their methods with some additional classes to power the menu There isn't much in terms of error checking, however if you would like to see this implemented, please let me know.

Have fun!
